# Momence tech task

This project uses bun + vite

To install packages run `bun install`

To run it locally run `bun run dev`

Page is deployed on vercel

# Notes

From task description it was necessary to CNB api for exchange rate.
This endpoint when called from client receives CORS issue, because
of that I wrote small [server](https://github.com/elijahmg/momence-server).

Server is deployed to https://render.com/
I'm using free tier, so they can suspend the server.

If page will be not responsive, please let me know, it might be caused by render suspending server.

Page has very simple design and it's not perfectly responsive on mobile :(

## If I'd have such task do deliver for a client what would I improve?

1. Better responsiveness for mobile
2. Better design of the table on mobile and maybe make proper date with td tr etc. html tags

## Hope to hear feedback soon :)
